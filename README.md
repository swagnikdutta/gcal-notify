# gcal-notify

This is part of a hobby [project](https://swagnikd.com/posts/the-hobby-project-that-drained-my-wallet-and-taught-me-things/) where I have a bulb that lights up when there's an ongoing event on my google calendar.

The application acts as a notifier whenever an event starts and ends on my google calendar. As of now, it only notifies [hue-agent](https://github.com/swagnikdutta/hue-agent) a small program that runs on a Raspberry Pi. I might add the capability to have multiple subscribers later.
